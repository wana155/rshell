signment 4: 
Tasks distribution: 
Task 1: Github Setup (10%) 
Task 2: Input redirection (For commands contain "<", 20%); 
Task 3: output redirection (For commands contain ">" and ">>", 20%); 
Task 4: Piping (25%) 
Task 5: construct test scripts (enough test cases, 15%)
Task 6: construct json and README files, and git commit (that means, all the works meaned from the part "Submission" to "Coding Conventions" in assignment 4 description)(10%) 

Students should break down their distribution in the group and write down on the README file, here is an example:

Arturo Perez: 
Task 1: Github Setup (5%) 
Task 2: Input redirection (For commands contain “<“, 20%); 
Task 3: output redirection (For commands contain ">" and “>>”,10%); 
Task 5: construct test scripts (enough test cases, 10%); 
Task 6: construct json and README files, and git commit (that means, all the works meaned from the part "Submission" to "Coding Conventions" in assignment 4 description)(5%)  total: 50%;

Stephanie Cabrera: 
Task 1: Github Setup (5%) 
Task 3: output redirection (For commands contain ">" and ">>", 10%); 
Task 4: Piping (25%) Task 5: construct test scripts (enough test cases, 5 %); 
Task 6: construct json and README files, and git commit (that means, all the works meaned from the part "Submission" to "Coding Conventions" in assignment 4 description)(5%)

Assignment 4: Input / Output Redirection
In this project, we expanded the functionality of the previous program rshell to work with the symbols >,>>,and <. This is done through the implementation the composite pattern. In this manner, the program runs the previous functions by creating and evaluating instances of the previous functions. At the same time, instances of redirection functionality will be executed from the same object type without differentiation. Over all the project is uncompleted and contains some bugs:

Test scripts do not run on rshell
